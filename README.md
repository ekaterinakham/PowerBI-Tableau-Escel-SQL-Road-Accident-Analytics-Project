Also, focusing on SQL for data processing and query creation.The project follows a structured approach, including data acquisition, cleaning, processing, modeling, and visualization.

**Data**
Road Accidents Data in United Kingdom 2011, 2022 (open source)

**Problem Statement**

The United Kingdom faces ongoing challenges related to road safety, with road accidents resulting in casualties and significant economic and social costs. To address this issue and make informed decisions, there is a need for a comprehensive Road Accident Dashboard that provides insights into accident data for the years 2021 and 2022.

**Analysis**

The objective is a development of a Road Accident Analysis for the United Kingdom, covering the years 2021 and 2022, to address the following key challenges and requirements:

_Dashboard Design and Visualization:_

An intuitive and user-friendly dashboards in Power BI, Tableau, and Excel ware created, allowing to access and understand road accident data.
Data visualization techniques (charts, graphs, maps) were effectively utilized.

_KPIs:_

Primary KPIs, including Total Casualties and Total Accidents, were identified and calculated for the years 2021 and 2022.
YoY growth percentages for these primary KPIs were calculated to assess trends and improvements.

_Accident Severity Analysis:_

Accident severity was analyzed by categorizing casualties into severity levels (e.g., Fatal, Serious, Minor) for both years.
YoY growth percentages for each severity level were calculated.

_Vehicle Type Analysis:_

Casualties based on vehicle types (e.g., Car, Truck, Motorcycle) for the years 2021 and 2022 were analyzed.
YoY growth percentages were considered to identify trends.

_Geospatial Analysis:_

Geospatial analysis was conducted to determine casualties and accidents by road type, location, and time of day for the UK in 2021 and 2022.

_Monthly Trends Comparison:_

A monthly trend analysis was created, allowing for a year-over-year comparison of casualties for 2021 and 2022.
